Today we are going to
		explore briefly how notes are represented. I will not cover all the theory and fundamentals as
		it would make this post too long, but just enough to write your first chord progression!</p> <h2>Tones and semitones</h2> <p>In western music, a <!> is the smallest step between two notes. On the
		MIDI grid, going up one row is going up by a semitone in pitch. Hence, a <!> is just two semitones, or two steps. When we go up twelve semitones, we
		reach an <!>, at which point notes just repeat themselves with a higher
		pitch.</p> <p>To illustrate this, let's look at the most common music <!>, C Major. I
		won't explain the name here but basically it is what you learn at school: do re mi fa sol la ti
		do! Note that the last do is the octave of the first do: it is the same note but higher in
		pitch! Here is how it looks when applying those units to the C Major scale:</p> <!> <!> <!> <p>It is common to use letters for naming notes, I wrote the equivalent letter next to each note.
		The semitone spacing is not the same between the notes, but it is not visible on the music
		sheet, at is was invented around this scale (yes music theory has an awful syntax, not better
		than maths).</p> <!> <h2>From notes to chords</h2> <p>"Ok, that's cool and all, but why do I have to know all this? I am bored." Well, that's because
		the most common and basic chords can be deducted from the scale! A <!> is
		a group of notes, as simple as that. And the spacing in semitones between each note creates a pattern
		to which we assign a name. For example, a <!> is a chord made of three notes.
		Usually, that is: the <!> (the first note, whatever you want!), coupled
		with the <!> and the <!> note when going up in the scale. Here
		is an example:</p> <!> <!> <!> <p><!></p> <p>The letter of the chord is defined by its fundamental, hence the first chord is a <!>, because the fundamental is a C. You might have noticed that there are weird abbreviations
		after the chord letters written on the music sheet (above the patch of notes played together).
		This defines the pattern following the fundamental. Here are three examples covering all the
		chords above:</p> <ul><li>The first chord, highlighted in red, is a <!>, or C <!>.
			It can be recognized by the number of semitones between notes. For a major chord, we do not
			write anything after the name (at times, it is written with the suffix "maj" or a capital
			"M"). It sounds <strong>happy</strong>! Can you spot the other major chords?</li> <li>The second chord, highlighted in blue, is a <!>, or D <!>. The only difference with the major chord is that the middle note (the <!>) is moved down by a semitone. This one will sound <strong>sad</strong>. Can you spot the
			other minor chords?</li> <li>The second to last chord, highlighted in green, is a <!>, or B <!>. It sounds a bit <strong>weird</strong> and <strong>scary</strong>, because frequencies do
			not overlap well. That's a great way to add tension to the music! That's the only one in this
			example.</li></ul> <!> <p>Notice that we can also change the order of notes! That's handy if they are too far apart in
		pitch. This is called a <!>. But then, how to figure out the
		name? Well, one combination can have multiple names. If we want to ensure we talk about the same
		chord than before transposition, we can indicate it like this: <!>. This means
		that the fundamental is a C (the chord is thus a C major), but the third note is the one with
		the lowest pitch. It gives: E, G, C (instead of C, E, G).</p> <h2>From chords to chord progressions</h2> <p>Yes, I know, it is long, but we are almost here! Now that we have a few basic chords at hand,
		the remaining question is: how do we combine them together?</p> <p>I already said that but, in music, sometimes there are no rules. Just tips and experimentation.
		When it comes to chords, <em>usually</em> one chord lasts one bar or half a bar. So, if we take
		the example from the last post, we have four to eight slots available, <em>in theory</em>. We
		also <em>commonly</em> try to have shared notes between the chord played and the next one, to make the
		transition smoother to the ear.</p> <p>In the next chapter I will break them all (by still taking this as a basis, don't worry), to
		show you how to make it sound more interesting! But for now let's take a look at a simple chord
		progression I wrote (I created a new instrument track and chose "Lofi Piano" as the instrument
		preset):</p> <!> <!> <!> <p>I started with a C major (<!>) chord to set a happy mood, during 1 bar as a
		basis. Then, I play an E minor (<!>), as it shares two notes with C major (<!>). It sounds surprisingly happy for a sad chord, I will explain that in the next chapter! I
		want the change to be a bit faster to give some variation and movement, so it only lasts 2
		beats, followed by a G major chord (<!>) lasting 2 beats too. Both <!> and <!> share a G note and a B note, they are just played at a different octave.
		I could have chosen to <!> the <!> chord, but I like the
		melody created by the highest note in pitch.</p> <!> <p>After that, I create a small surprise by bringing in sadness with an A minor (<!>). The change is sharp as no note is shared between <!> and <!>. I give it 6 bars to let the sadness express himself, but quickly bring back joy with another <!>. It serves as a smooth transition back to the start of the chord progression,
		by using G as the common note between the chords <!> and <!>.</p> <!> <h2>Wrapping things up</h2> <p>You must be hating me at this point. I don't blame you, music theory was not created to be
		intuitive unfortunately. But it starts to open interesting doors, we can now add emotions to our
		rhythm! Now, it is your turn to try! It is OK if it sounds weird!</p> <p>If you are really uncomfortable trying it out, well you can pick <!>. Feel free to combine them one after the other, and to not stick to each chord having the same
		duration! If you struggle to find their notes, try <!> and pick a chord name.</p> <p>I know I am going fast and skipping things. Remember, it is just an introduction to the world of
		music composition, that's OK to be lost, or not able to create your own work!</p> <p>Next time, we will see how to improve the example chord progression to make it more spicy. But
		for now, don't hesitate to ask questions and share your chord progressions in the comments!</p> <p>Have a nice day, afternoon, evening, or night!</p> <p>~ Charly</p> <p>PS: It is shorter than the last post, I counted ;). The next one will be even shorter, I swear!</p> <h2>Resources (for help or to dig deeper)</h2> <ul><li>About roman numerals: <!></li> <li>Popular chord progressions: <!></li> <li>(advanced) Additional chord progressions theory: <!></li> <li>Chord identifier: <!></li> <li>Chord name to its corresponding notes: <!></li> <li>More chord types available at the top left of this cheat sheet (it also illustrate a few
