		In this post, I will show you how we can make it sound more interesting, by introducing all
		kinds of variations.</p> <!> <h2>What we start from</h2> <p>As a reminder, here is the chord progression we ended up with in the last chapter:</p> <!> <!> <!> <p>It sounds good, and actually some songs keep things simple like that. However, it is totally
		possible and easy to make it slightly more sophisticated, without compromising on the simplicity
		of it.</p> <h2>Chords variations, or how to season your chords</h2> <p>With a bit of seasoning, this is what I personally came up with (I added the drum loop from chapter 2 in the audio):</p> <!> <!> <!> <h3>Variation inside the chord progression</h3> <p>Let's first focus on the first iteration, to talk about what we can change on the chord
		progression itself.</p> <!> <p>The first useful tip is to <strong>change where chords start and stop</strong>. Notice how the
		first chord, <!>, ends slightly before the next bar. At the same time, the next
		chord, <!>, starts slightly before as well to adjust the change. This kind of
		basic anticipation breaks the monotony a bit. I did it quite a lot here, to it sounds a bit like
		I shifted the whole pattern and only created the effect at the start. But you can do it much
		more sparingly, it will still sound good. I also shortened the two <!> chords, they
		are now more like transition chords, which also conveys some kind of nice melody.</p> <p>Another thing you can do is to <strong>alter the chords themselves</strong>. There are a <em>lot</em> of different types of chords, and I don't know most of them (<!> and <!> alone prove it). I don't want to learn them all either. Instead, I follow those three approaches:</p> <ul><li><strong>Trying random things:</strong> it might sound stupid, but sometimes it works. I discovered
			nice patterns that way! I will admit though that it is harder to find something that sounds good
			that way when you begin. Still, I did use this technique from the very start, and it did help me a
			lot!</li> <li><strong>Doing some research on the genre I target:</strong> Sometimes genres have chords typically
			used with them, or signature patterns that makes you immediately say: that's this genre. It can
			give you a hint at how to tweak your chords, or even give you a recipe.</li> <li><strong>Keep in mind a short list of chords you love, or know what they do:</strong> basically
			make yourself a cheat-sheet (in your mind or on paper!). Here are some examples (I will use <!> as a basis for
			the examples): <ul><li><!> (like <!>): Sounds dreamy (used in Animal Crossing music at sunset for
					example).</li> <li><!> (like <!>): Signature chord of blues, quite common in general, sounds
					happy and sad at the same time. I use it at bar 4 with a <!>.</li> <li><!> (like <!> or <!>): Sounds happy (or dreamy/strange
					in some contexts), and like a teaser to something coming after.</li> <li><!> and <!> (like <!> or <!>): Fear, stress, tension, suspense,
					you name it. You can't miss it. It sounds like you messed up, but no. Also contains the <!>, which was associated with the devil at some point in the Middle Age.</li></ul></li></ul> <h3>Variation across loops (OPTIONAL)</h3> <p>Another good thing to do sometimes is just to have variations of the same chord progression to
		make something bigger and less repetitive. It isn't as efficient as a 8 bars chord progression
		written from the ground up, but it still makes it sound less repetitive.</p> <!> <p>Here, I add a transition chord at 7.4 between <!> and <!>.
		That's an example of a random experiment I liked (it could be <!> but here the fact that it sounds good is enough for me, I won't make a music sheet out of it so...).
		I also turned the last <!> into a <!>. It makes some variation,
		ease transition with <!> through the shared E, and creates a surprise that still
		sounds good (another randomly good finding here!).</p> <!> <h2>Closing words</h2> <p>With all that said, you now have some tools to make more spicy chord progressions! It is ready
		for our next chapter: the melody and the bass line! As always, don't hesitate to ask questions,
		and do not worry if you read through it without understanding much of it. It is my fault for
		choosing such a hard blog topic after all.</p> <p>Anyway, now I only have to wish you a good day, afternoon, evening or night, and I see you in
		the next post! (Or in the comments!)</p> <p>~ Charly</p> <p>PS: Complain as you want, the post is shorter for the second time in a row ðŸ˜‰. Twice shorter
		than the last one actually.</p>`,1);function Ve(g){ue(g,{config:ge,postTitle:"4 - Chords: making a chord progression more interesting",postContent:v=>{var c=Se(),$=e(ce(c),2);te($,{title:"Note",content:"My chord progression example is based on a ternary pattern introduced optionally at chapter 2.
