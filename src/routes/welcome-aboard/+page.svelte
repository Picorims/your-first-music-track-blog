		Music composition might sound like something completely unreachable to the average person. You
		might think that you need expensive software and hardware, and years of knowledge in music
		theory, sound design, mixing and mastering. But the truth is: it is no harder to pick than
		learning to draw. Drawing can get extremely complex with advanced theory requiring many tools.
		Still, any child can start drawing given a paper and a pencil. And, like drawing, it can be an
		enjoyable activity no matter how experienced you are. After a bit of basic knowledge in place,
		you can then, in the same way, explore many styles, which in music we call
		<span class="technical-term">genres</span>. And that's what make it so interesting. There is
		always room for exploration, for learning new things, for <em>trying</em> new things.
		<br /> That's why I picked this subject: to make it more accessible, and because you can easily adjust
		it to your taste.

		This is the challenge that I want you to try. Even if you never did music, or have no knowledge
		about music theory. Because while everyone knows what music is, music composition is no more
		complicated. Pick instruments, write a rhythm, a melody, a chord progression or a bass line for
		each of them, mix and match, and voil√†! No seriously, it is hardly more complicated than that,
		it just takes some time, but for a starting point that is pretty much it.

	<p>So, ready to get started? Then see you on the first chapter!</p>
