	<p>
		In the last chapter, I introduced a list of common effects commonly used in music production.
		Now is the time to see how we can put them in practice! I will use the song introduced in
		chapter 5 to illustrate how I personally processed each instrument.
	</p>
	<p>
		As last time, <strong>I won't enter into the detail of each settings</strong> to keep things
		concise and accessible, but only explain the overall approach (well, "concise", but don't worry,
		it is mostly padded by images). And to be honest I cannot explain all of those settings either
		anyway ðŸ˜…. <strong>Feel free to pick only the sections that spark your interest</strong>, I
		suggest though to compare the different audio examples. (The drums and piano are the most
		detailed ones.)
		<strong
			><em>At the very least</em>, I suggest listening to differences, having a quick look at the
			pictures and reading the conclusion.</strong
		>
	</p>

	<p>
		For reference, here is the full song without effects, and with all the effects (plus those on
		instruments not explained here).
	</p>

	</label>

	<h2>Drums</h2>

	<p>
		For this track, I started off the "lofi dirt" preset, which you can find in the effects tab at
		the bottom left, and then in the dropdown menu under the preset thumbnail. To get a lo-fi vibe,
		I wanted to intentionally make it sound a bit altered in quality and warmer.
	</p>
	<p>
		To do so, the BL Driver effects slightly destroy the signal, and make the drums sound a bit
		"slobbery". Then, the limiter slightly reduce the dynamics amplitude ("volume contrast" if you
		want), also to get the feel of low quality. I am not sure what the preset compender achieve, but
		I believe that its goal is similar to the limiter while keeping a bit of dynamics. I then added
		an EQ to amplify the low-mediums and reduce the highs, so that it sounds warmer and comfy.
		Finally, the de-esser makes cymbals less shiny.
	</p>

	<h2>Reverse cymbal</h2>

	<p>
		Again, I used the BL Driver effect to make the cymbal sound a bit altered. Because it is high
		pitched, I reinforced the mediums this time, but kept some highs to make it stand out in the mix
		(there aren't much highs in all the tracks). To give it depth, I added a subtle delay and a
		semi-long reverb (the delay and reverb are a common combo by the way).
	</p>

		alt="Reverse cymbal effects part 2"
		caption="Reverse cymbal effects part 2"
	/>

	<h2>Piano</h2>

	<p>
		This pipeline is based of the "bright reverb" preset. The chorus slightly color and reinforce
		the stereo of the piano. A subtle reverb then gives it a bit more depth. The EQ reinforces the
		mediums which is the dominant area of a piano, so that it stands out more. But to not make it
		too bright, the highs are slightly reduced. Then comes a compressor to make it a bit more
		energetic and powerful. Finally, to give it more rhythmic and make it more interesting, I added
		a shy sidechain, which reinforces the kick (which we don't hear in the following examples).

	<Image src={pianoEffectsImg2} alt="Piano effects part 2" caption="Piano effects part 2" />

	<h2>Bass</h2>

	<p>
		The bass instrument itself is mostly left untouched as it only serves as a low frequencies
		booster. Most of the dynamics comes from the superposed piano which plays the same notes at a
		very low pitch. Hence, the lows are reinforced, and the compressor boosts the bass a bit.
	</p>

	<h2>Agressive electric piano (chorus melody)</h2>

	<p>
		I used a similar approach as the piano for the electric piano used in the melody. So I won't go
		into the details, but you can have a look at the settings below and listen to the examples to
		compare. I just use different settings or modules (space maker is a reverb).
	</p>

		alt="Agressive electric piano effects part 2"
		caption="Agressive electric piano effects part 2"
	/>

	<h2>Soft electric piano (verse melody)</h2>

	<p>
		The explanation is the same as for the aggressive electric piano. The only twist is that there
		are two chained echo effects, a fast, subtle one and a slower, more pronounced one. I could have
		put an EQ, but didn't feel the need. BandLab doesn't provide frequency spectrums in the free
		tier, so it is hard to spot silent but problematic frequencies.
	</p>

		alt="Soft electric piano effects part 2"
		caption="Soft electric piano effects part 2"
	/>

	<h2>Organ</h2>

	<p>
		The chorus is particularly powerful on mono like sounds (where the left and right channels sound
		almost the same, or exactly for true mono). The VibeToo is a custom effect from BandLab, which
		seems to be some kind of advanced pitch shifting effect. Here, it helps breaking the monotony,
		but pitch shifting can be used for many purposes, from weirdness to anxiety!

	<Image src={organEffectsImg} alt="Organ effects" caption="Organ effects" />

	<h2>Rain</h2>

	<p>
		Here, the lows are increased to give warmth, and the high to reinforce the rain effect. The
		reverb is here to improve the stereo and immersion of the rain.
	</p>

		Rain without effects:
		<Audio src={rainNoEffects} loop />

	<h2>Chorus pad</h2>

	<p>I know, I know, it is the last one I showcase here.</p>
	<p>
		This one is a great example of how sidechain can really add to making something more rhythmic.
		Additionally, I make the pad shinier by increasing the highs, and lowering the lows. The
		compressor only makes it more powerful. There is also a tremolo hidden within the instrument
		preset (which I have no access to, unfortunately). This is what creates the feeling like you are
		speaking in front of a fan with your voice trembling. This one is subtle, but can be easily
		heard in the example with no effect.

	<h2>Closing words</h2>

	<p>
		All of this is certainly overwhelming, especially if you are unfamiliar with signal processing.
		Mixing and effects are certainly not the most glamorous aspect of music composition (although
		you can have a lot of fun creating crazy stuff with it!). But if I make the parallel to drawing
		(again), <strong
			>remember you are your baby self right now, taking the pencil in your hand for the first time,
			and making your first drawing on a piece of paper.</strong
		>. Did you know about the importance of choosing the right colors? Probably not. Did you know
		about the difference between using a pen and a pencil? You probably didn't care. Did you know
		about shading and perspective? If you did, that's impressive, but I doubt it was the case. It
		took you time to learn all of this. And in the same way, it takes time to familiarize yourself
		with all of those effects and those settings (and music theory!). <strong>And it is OK.</strong>
		Add the parts that sparks your interest bit by bit, don't rush things, and everything will go smoothly.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the next chapter, I will talk about how to add more depth to our mix. This one will be
		easier, and much shorter, as I will stick to some handy tips.
	</p>

	<p>
		For now, I wish you a good day, afternoon, evening or night, and I see you in the next post!

		PS: Nope, it <em>isn't</em> the longest post, not even the second longest! OK, <em>possibly</em>
		the third. But I said that you can read any part you want, so... Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
